       Introduction <br>

        Microplastics are tiny plastic particles that result from both commercial product development and the breakdown of larger plastics. As a pollutant, microplastics can be harmful to the environment and animal health.
        
        In other word, Once at sea, sunlight, wind, and wave action break down plastic waste into small particles, often less than one-fifth of an inch across. These so-called microplastics are spread throughout the water column and have been found in every corner of the globe, from Mount Everest, the highest peak, to the Mariana Trench, the deepest trough. 
        
        
        They have become a source of increasing concern both by scientists and the general public because they are a threat to the environment

        2.2 Types                                                         
        There are two categories of microplastics,on the basis of their size and the vast arrays of colours..
        <br>
        1.Primary microplastic<br>

        2. Secondary microplastic<br>
        <br>
        
        
        
        Primary microplastics are tiny particles designed for commercial use, such as cosmetics, as well as microfibers shed from clothing and other textiles, such as fishing nets.These products are of special concern, as it has been estimated that approximately 6% of all liquid skin-cleaning products sold in the EU, Switzerland and Norway contain microplastics, of which more than 93% consist of polyethylene (PE).17 Another key source of primary microplastics are the raw materials used in the manufacture of plastic items. Inadequate handling, accidental loss, run-off from processing facilities and residues from the production process can lead to the accumulation of primary microplastics. Present in air-blasting media, microplastics are also used, to a smaller degree, in medicine, namely as drug vectors.9 After their use, microplastics are discharged in domestic wastewaters and may reach the environment.12, 18Sources of primary microplastics as well as their specific origins can be identified and therefore mitigation actions to reduce their input into the environment can be developed.

        <br>Secondary microplastics are particles that result from the breakdown of larger plastic items, such as water bottles. This breakdown is caused by exposure to environmental factors, mainly the sunâ€™s radiation and ocean waves.When exposed to the elements, physical, chemical and biological processes can lead to reduction of the structural integrity of these plastics, leading to their fragmentation.19 However, this breakdown can also take place before these materials enter the environment, as is the case of synthetic fibres from clothes released during washing cycles or the wear-and-tear of car tires, which generates minute polymeric fragments.
